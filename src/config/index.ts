      I started learning how to design and code websites when I was a kid, about 20 years ago. Back then, there was no one around to tell these are usually two different jobs. And so I grew up, believing that designing with code is the most natural way to go.

      Today, I work as a Staff  Product Designer at Castle and run several side projects, such as Design with Code and Launch UI. I also occiasionally write, speak at and organize conferences.
